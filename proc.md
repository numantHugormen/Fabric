        Verify completeness of the request form and request additional information if needed.

Step 2: Preliminary Assessment

    Feasibility Assessment
        Conduct a preliminary assessment to determine the technical feasibility of the project.
        Identify potential data sources, required technologies, and initial resource estimation.

    Stakeholder Identification
        Identify key stakeholders (project sponsor, data owners, end-users).
        Set up an initial meeting to discuss project objectives, scope, and expectations.

Step 3: Detailed Project Scoping

    Define Project Scope
        Outline the project scope, including deliverables, timelines, and key milestones.
        Identify data requirements and availability.
        Determine success criteria and key performance indicators (KPIs).

    Risk Assessment
        Conduct a risk assessment to identify potential challenges and mitigation strategies.
        Document potential risks related to data privacy, security, and compliance.

Step 4: Resource Allocation

    Resource Planning
        Identify required resources, including personnel, technology, and budget.
        Assign roles and responsibilities to team members.
        Create a resource allocation plan.

    Budget Approval
        Prepare a detailed budget proposal.
        Obtain budget approval from relevant stakeholders.

Step 5: Project Approval and Kickoff

    Approval Process
        Present the project proposal to the project approval committee or executive board.
        Obtain formal approval to proceed with the project.

    Project Kickoff Meeting
        Schedule a kickoff meeting with all stakeholders.
        Review project scope, timeline, and responsibilities.
        Establish communication channels and reporting mechanisms.

Step 6: Detailed Planning and Design

    Detailed Project Plan
        Develop a detailed project plan, including task breakdown, timelines, and dependencies.
        Create a data management plan outlining data collection, storage, processing, and security measures.

    Design Phase
        Design the project architecture, including data pipelines, models, and analytics tools.
        Prepare detailed technical specifications and documentation.

Step 7: Execution and Monitoring

    Implementation
        Begin project implementation according to the detailed project plan.
        Regularly monitor progress against milestones and timelines.
        Conduct regular status meetings and update stakeholders.

    Quality Assurance
        Implement quality assurance processes to ensure data integrity and accuracy.
        Perform testing and validation of data models and analytics outputs.

Step 8: Evaluation and Reporting

    Project Evaluation
        Conduct a post-implementation review to evaluate project outcomes against objectives and KPIs.
        Document lessons learned and best practices.

    Reporting
        Prepare and present a final project report to stakeholders.
        Include findings, insights, and recommendations for future projects.

Step 9: Handoff and Maintenance

    Handoff
        Transition the project deliverables to the relevant operational teams.
        Provide training and support as needed.

    Ongoing Maintenance
        Establish a maintenance plan for ongoing support and updates.
        Monitor project performance and address any issues that arise.

This structured intake process ensures that Data & AI projects are thoroughly evaluated, planned, and executed, leading to successful outcomes and alignment with organizational goals.
